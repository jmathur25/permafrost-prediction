To facilitate reproduction, raw inputs were saved using Zenodo.

First, I ran:
```bash
cd src
python3 -m pp.data.prepare_for_backup
```

Then, I manually uploaded:
1. All the archived interferograms in `works/isce2_outputs`
1. `work/temperature/barrow/data.csv` to `temperature.csv`
1. `work/calm/data/u1/data.csv` to `calm.csv`
